    <p>Golden milk — also known as turmeric milk — is an Indian drink that has been gaining popularity in Western cultures. This bright yellow beverage is traditionally made by warming up cow's or plant-based milk with turmeric and other spices, such as cinnamon and ginger</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh turmeric root, peeled and grated</li>

        <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
            
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            
        <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
            
        <li>1 pinch ground turmeric</li>
            
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to be followed</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>
        Combine turmeric root, ginger root, and honey together in a bowl, crushing the turmeric and ginger as much as possible.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li>
        Heat almond milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Once small bubbles begin to form around the edges, reduce heat to low. Transfer about 2 tablespoon milk to turmeric mixture to allow mixture to soften and honey to melt into a paste-like mixture.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li>
        Mix the turmeric paste into milk in the saucepan; raise temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until fully combined. Blend with an immersion blender for a smooth texture.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li>
        Pour turmeric tea into a mug and top with ground turmeric and cinnamon</li>
        <br>
    </ol>
